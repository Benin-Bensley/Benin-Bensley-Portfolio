# [Project 1 : Tableau: Online Mart Company Sales Dashboard] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benin.bensley/viz/TableauPersonalProject_17281092379440/Dashboard1)

This Tableau dashboard is a portfolio project where I designed interactive data visualizations for an Online Mart company. The dashboard includes various charts that represent trends across different regions, months, and categories of products. Users can interact with the dashboard through multiple filters, enabling them to analyze region-wise performance, track trends over time, and review category-specific data. The dynamic filters empower decision-makers to quickly assess key business metrics and make informed decisions based on regional and category insights.
